# :rocket: AI-Powered Full-Stack Project with Next.js 13.4  

TestifyAi is an AI-driven testing platform built with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, powered by OpenAI's GPT API. It features customizable quizzes, performance analytics, and dark/light themes. Integrated with Google OAuth (NextAuth) and scalable data management via Prisma and Supabase, it ensures secure and efficient user data handling.
